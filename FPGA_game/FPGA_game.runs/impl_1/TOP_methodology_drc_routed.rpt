2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.069 ns between scan_seg_m0/data_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and scan_seg_m0/C_out_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.218 ns between scan_seg_m0/data_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and scan_seg_m0/C_out_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.233 ns between scan_seg_m0/data_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and scan_seg_m0/C_out_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
